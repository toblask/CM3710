# CM3710

-	A complete implementation of at least two AI algorithms on a selected dataset. (submitted as a Github repository and coded in Python).  
-	An evaluation report describing experimental procedure adopted, the algorithms compared and the outcomes of the experiment. (1,400 words max, PDF file).

The COURSEWORK PART 2 DROPBOX on the module CampusMoodle page, you should submit a PDF file containing:
-	A link to the GitHub repository hosting your code and dataset.
-	The evaluation report


Learning Outcomes Assessed
3.	Compare and contrast the main techniques within machine learning and Artificial Intelligence.
4.	Develop an intelligent system using suitable machine learning and/or Artificial Intelligence techniques to solve a given problem.

Use a dataset provided by your business as the basis to create and compare two AI models


1.	Applied AI System
Implement two distinct AI algorithms on the selected dataset. The implementation should demonstrate your capability to:
-	Perform any necessary preprocessing or data analysis before applying AI to your dataset.
-	Implement at least two distinct AI methods to perform either a classification, optimisation or clustering task on your selected dataset.
-	Produce appropriate metrics as to evaluate the performance of the AI model on this task.
All aspects of the implementation should follow best practice as taught in the lectures or identified through individual research. 

Functional code should be maintained and submitted in a GitHub repository. Please ensure the GitHub repository is made public prior to submission, and that a link is provided in the evaluation report so that it is accessible.

You must ensure that you are able to share the dataset you have used to train and test your AI models. The dataset should either be linked in the GitHub repository or submitted following the large file policy (i.e. as a zip folder on OneDrive). Failure to submit or identify your dataset will result in a penalty for this component of the assessment. 



2.	Evaluation Report
Describe the process of conducting your experiment. This should include 3 mandatory sections, as detailed below.

Introduction: The introduction should clearly identify the problem which you are aiming to resolve and why AI is suitable for this task. Additionally, you should introduce the dataset you will use for your experiments. Make sure to discuss the task, features and labels of the dataset in an appropriate level of detail. (Maximum of 400 words).  

Description of AI Algorithms: In this section you should evidence your theoretical understanding by describing the two AI algorithms which you plan to compare. You should pay particular attention to the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm to highlight why it is suitable for use on this specific dataset. (Maximum of 500 words).

Results of Experiment and Discussion: The results section should analyse the outcomes of the experiment to identify the best performing AI algorithm. Performance metrics visualised using graphs or tables are very much encouraged. The hypothesis for why this algorithm performed best on this particular dataset should be discussed. Future work should be described with the aim of bringing the developed AI system to a standard which could be applied in the real world. (Maximum of 500 words).

Throughout all sections of the evaluation report, references are encouraged where appropriate to support discussion.
